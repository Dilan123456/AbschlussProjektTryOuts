Manual for the student reviewing my project:

To run the application you will have to create a python environment using the requirements.txt file.

To start the web-application you have to switch to the directory of the app folder and run the project with the following command:
flask run

In the Folder images_Kopie you will find 3 Subfolders. The Subfolder labeled as test contains images you can use to test the 
application and response. The test-subfolder contains 30 Subfolders each one representing a category of waste. 
Every Category contains 350 images to choose from, which you can upload on to the web application.


Motivation Behind the Project

In todays world, waste management is an increasingly critical issue as we grapple with the environmental impacts of improperly disposed waste. 
The problem at hand is the inefficient and often incorrect classification of waste, leading to significant challenges in recycling processes and 
overall waste management. Misclassification of trash can lead to contamination of recyclable materials, increased landfill waste, and environmental 
pollution.

Problem

The primary problem this project addresses is the need for an accurate, automated system to classify waste into correct categories. 
The manual sorting of waste is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also prone to human error. An effective solution to this problem can 
significantly enhance recycling efficiency and contribute to a more sustainable environment.

Motivation

The motivation behind developing a neural network for image-based trash classification stems from the urgent need to improve waste management practices globally. 
By leveraging machine learning and neural networks, we can create a system that assists individuals and organizations in accurately sorting waste, 
thereby reducing the strain on recycling facilities and minimizing the environmental footprint.

Relevance of the Project

This project is highly relevant in the context of global environmental sustainability efforts. Effective waste classification and management are crucial for reducing pollution, 
conserving natural resources, and ensuring the longevity of our planet. By providing an accessible tool that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, 
this project empowers users to contribute to these sustainability goals.

Moreover, this project aligns with the broader push towards smart cities and the integration of technology into everyday life to solve practical problems. 
It also showcases the potential of artificial intelligence in creating impactful solutions for environmental challenges, promoting a cleaner, greener future for all.

The initial model showed significant overfitting, indicated by the high training accuracy but much lower validation accuracy and increasing validation loss. 
The model learned the training data well but failed to generalize on new data. This overfitting is likely due to the lack of regularization techniques 
such as dropout and data augmentation.

The second model includes data augmentation and dropout to reduce overfitting and was trained for 10 epochs:

Training Accuracy: Started at 9.69% and improved to 57.39%.
Validation Accuracy: Started at 22.84% and improved to 49.51%.
Training Loss: Started at 3.2969 and reduced to 1.4541.

The use of a pre-trained model significantly improved the models performance. MobileNetV2 provided a strong feature extraction backbone, and fine-tuning allowed 
the model to adapt these features to the specific trash classification task. The introduction of a learning rate scheduler and early stopping also contributed 
to more stable and effective training, preventing overfitting and ensuring the models generalization capability.

Benchmark comparison:

To ensure the robustness and effectiveness of our deep learning model based on MobileNetV2, we compared its performance to a benchmark model, 
specifically a Random Forest classifier. The comparison was conducted using the same dataset and evaluation metrics to maintain consistency and fairness.

We trained a Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators using the same training and validation datasets. The features were extracted from the images 
by flattening them into one-dimensional arrays. Here are the performance metrics of the Random Forest classifier:

Accuracy: 59.42%
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Varied across different classes with an average 
precision of approximately 61%, recall of 59%, and F1-score of 59%.

The confusion matrix showed that while the Random Forest classifier performed reasonably well on some classes, it struggled with others, 
indicating a moderate overall performance.

Random Forest Accuracy
0.5942222222222222

The MobileNetV2 model, fine-tuned with additional dense layers and trained with data augmentation techniques, 
demonstrated significantly better performance:

Best Training Accuracy: 99.23%
Validation Accuracy: 84.13%
Validation Loss: 0.6932

The MobileNetV2 model consistently achieved high accuracy and low validation loss across multiple epochs, 
indicating its superior ability to generalize from the training data to unseen validation data.
